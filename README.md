CMD tool to provide understanding &amp; solutions to error occurred during runtime

#Rough Idea - 

Creating a package or tool like the one you described involves a few steps. Here's a general guide on how you might approach this:

1. **Understand OpenAI API:**
   - Familiarize yourself with the OpenAI API and its usage. Obtain the API key from OpenAI.

2. **Create a New NPM Package:**
   - Create a new Node.js package to encapsulate your tool. You can initialize a new Node.js project using `npm init`.

3. **Integrate with OpenAI API:**
   - Use a Node.js library to make requests to the OpenAI API. Axios is a popular choice for making HTTP requests in Node.js. Install it using `npm install axios`.

4. **Create the Zoro CLI:**
   - Develop a command-line interface (CLI) for Zoro. This CLI should listen to error events in the VS Code terminal.

5. **Capture VS Code Terminal Output:**
   - Utilize a VS Code extension or npm package to capture the error messages from the terminal. An example could be the `node-pty` library.

6. **Send Errors to OpenAI API:**
   - When an error is captured, send it to the OpenAI API for analysis. Format the error information appropriately for the API.

7. **Receive and Display GPT-Generated Responses:**
   - Once you receive the response from the OpenAI API, display it in the VS Code terminal. You may need to parse and format the response for better readability.

8. **Handle API Rate Limits and Errors:**
   - Implement error handling mechanisms for API failures or rate limiting to ensure a smooth user experience.

9. **Package Zoro:**
   - Package your tool as an npm package so that developers can easily install and use it in their projects. Use `npm publish` to publish the package.

10. **Documentation:**
   - Provide clear documentation on how to install, configure, and use Zoro in a React or Next.js project.

11. **Testing:**
   - Test your tool extensively to ensure it works seamlessly with different types of errors and projects.

12. **Security Considerations:**
   - Ensure that your tool handles sensitive information, such as API keys, securely. Follow best practices for securing your code.

Remember that integrating with an external service like the OpenAI API might involve costs, depending on your usage. Be sure to review the OpenAI pricing and terms of service.

Please note that building such a tool requires a good understanding of Node.js, npm, and VS Code extension development. Additionally, it's essential to respect privacy and security considerations when dealing with error messages and API requests.
